# mage-flow-swift

MLX-Swift port of Microsoft's **[Mage-Flow-Edit](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Mage-Flow-Edit-Turbo)**
— native-resolution instruction-based image editing on Apple Silicon (MIT).

**Working end-to-end.** Image + instruction → edited image, with live Qwen3-VL
conditioning, the mandatory Responsible-AI content filter, and the
Gaussian-Shading provenance watermark, all reproduced.

```bash
swift build -c release
.build/release/mage-flow-edit \
  --repo <Mage-Flow-Edit-Turbo snapshot dir> \
  --ref dog.jpg --prompt "make the background a snowy forest" \
  --out edit.png
```

`<snapshot dir>` is a downloaded `microsoft/Mage-Flow-Edit-*` repo plus a
`folded_adaln.safetensors` at its root. The baked artifact + a ready model card
live at **[xocialize/Mage-Flow-Edit-Turbo-mlx](https://huggingface.co/xocialize/Mage-Flow-Edit-Turbo-mlx)**
(`Weights/folded_adaln.safetensors` here is the same file); regenerate with
`Weights/dump_folded_adaln.py`.

## Scope

`Mage-Flow-Edit-Turbo` (4-step, cfg 1.0) is validated end-to-end. The other five
family checkpoints share every parity-locked component (VAE, DiT architecture,
Qwen3-VL, scheduler) but are **not yet runnable** here: the Base/RL edit
checkpoints need the CFG / `batch_cfg` denoise path (cfg > 1), and the three
T2I checkpoints need the text-to-image path (no reference image, `start_idx=34`
template). Both are the next steps.

## Components (all parity-locked vs the PyTorch oracle, CPU stream)

| component | worst rel error | gate |
|---|---|---|
| MageFlow NR-MMDiT (12-block, 4.1B) | 6.8e-6 | `MageFlowGate` |
| MageVAE (encode + decode) | 1.08e-5 | `MageVAEGate` |
| Gaussian-Shading watermark | 0 (bit-exact) | `GSGate` |
| FlowMatchEuler schedule | exact | Turbo 4-step to the digit |
| end-to-end 4-step denoise | 2.8e-2 | `E2EGate` (bf16-oracle vs fp32) |

Qwen3-VL-4B conditioning + the content filter come from
[qwen3vl-mlx-swift](https://github.com/xocialize/qwen3vl-mlx-swift).

## Notes that cost real debugging (full detail in `PORTING-SPEC.md`)

- **The DiT runs in fp32 on the edit path.** bf16 weights load fine, but the
  MLX-Swift bf16 attention/GEMM produces grid garbage at ≥512² on Apple GPUs
  (the same failure that makes Boogu-Image use `useFP32DiT: true`; upstream runs
  bf16 cleanly on CUDA, so it's a Metal-kernel issue, not the math). `MAGEFLOW_BF16`
  opts back in once a surgical fix (fp32 SDPA only) lands.
- **The timestep embedding is bf16-rounded twice** — the sigma *and* the
  frequency table. At scale-1000 sinusoid arguments a 0.2% bf16 shift moves
  cos/sin by radians. Layer parity was perfect (6.8e-6) yet the sampler was
  105% wrong until this was found — visible only end-to-end.
- **VL conditioning needs PIL BICUBIC**, not CoreGraphics — the ViT is
  resampling-sensitive (cos 0.93 → garbage vs 0.98 → clean).
- **The VAE adaLN fold must be baked, not recomputed** (bf16 fold, one channel
  off by 0.039 → 1.2 error while cosine read 1.00000000).
- **`sample_posterior` is True at runtime** despite the config saying false.

## Gates

Each gate drives one component against captured oracle goldens on the CPU stream,
gating on *relative* error (this network's activations reach ~1e5, so absolute
tolerances mislead).
